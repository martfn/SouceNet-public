# soucenet-public
A public version of the SouceNet project, a private network and website I made.

# Story (copied from the Blog page)
 The SouceNet project began at the night of September 21st, 2021. It was created by mart, who decided to try creating some sort of network after hearing about it in school, he later assigned diog as the co-creator of SouceNet.

SouceNet aims to be a private network used as a way to educate its creators and others about how HTML (and the back end of the internet in general) works. We like to call it our own internet, however it isn’t exactly like the internet.

On SouceNet you can currently find a simple homepage, with no links to anything whatsoever. We want to, in the future, add an instant messaging/chat service and a file exchange service. The SouceNet is ran on a laptop at the moment, so we can’t go with fancy things like voice/video chat and videos (like YouTube).

We don’t really expect anything big out of this, just a simple project from some people interested in internet-y stuff.
